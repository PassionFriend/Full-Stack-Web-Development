# Full-Stack-Web-Development
This course teaches full stack web development using PHP.

How should you use resources available here - 
  1. There are 2 different directories for CSE-B and CSE-C, which will be updated periodically.
  2. We are going to start this course in a top to bottom fashion i.e. begin with PHP (Backend) and gradually understand the concepts of HTML, CSS and Java Script (Frontend).
  3. We will invest our considerable time in learning Java Script through some small assignments (games/mini-projects).
  4. Students should create separate repositories where they will keep pushing solutions of assignments.
  5. In later phase of this course, multiple students (a team of 4 to 6 students) should collaborate on the projects.
  6. Tutorials will be updated frequently in main directory and lectures and labs will
     focus on solving these tutorials.
